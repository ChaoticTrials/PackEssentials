This mod is mainly for my own modpacks. If I need something which can't be added by another mod, it'll be added here.
Some easier stuff is also included, such as basic items.

This mod can be configured for each modpack to only include the required items/blocks/features.

If you're an end user of a modpack, **DO NOT EDIT THE CONFIG**! This will likely break all modpacks which use this mod.
